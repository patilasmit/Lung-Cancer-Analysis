# Lung Cancer Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the prediction and analysis of lung cancer cases using data visualization and machine learning techniques. 
The dataset includes various features like smoking status, age, survival time, and stage of cancer, and is used to build models and generate insights to help in the early detection and treatment of lung cancer.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **MySQL**: Used for data management, querying, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and creating interactive reports.
- **DAX**: Used for creating measures and calculated columns within Power BI to generate insights.

## Project Objective
- Predict the likelihood of lung cancer in patients based on various factors.
- Analyze the survival rate, smoking risks, and treatment effects.
- Provide insights to help doctors make informed decisions.
