1. Total Lung Cancer Cases
Total Lung Cancer Cases = COUNTROWS('LungCancerData')

2. Average Age of Lung Cancer Patients
Average Age of Lung Cancer Patients = AVERAGE('LungCancerData'[Age])

3. Percentage of Smokers with Lung Cancer
Percentage of Smokers with Lung Cancer = 
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'), 'LungCancerData'[Smoker] = "Yes"), COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'))

This calculates the count of smokers with lung cancer and divides it by the total number of lung cancer cases to get the percentage.

4. Mortality Rate for Lung Cancer Patients
Mortality Rate for Lung Cancer Patients = 
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'), 'LungCancerData'[Survived] = "No"), COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'))

This formula counts the number of deceased patients (where "Survived" = "No") and divides it by the total number of lung cancer cases to get the mortality rate.


5. Total Smokers
Total Smokers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'), 'LungCancerData'[Smoker] = "Yes")

6. Average Years of Smoking
Average Years of Smoking = AVERAGE('LungCancerData'[YearsSmoking])

7. High-Risk Patients (Risk Score > 5)
High-Risk Patients = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'), 'LungCancerData'[RiskScore] > 5)

8. Early Detection Rate
Early Detection Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'), DATEDIFF('LungCancerData'[SymptomsDate], 'LungCancerData'[DiagnosisDate], MONTH) <= 6),
    COUNTROWS('LungCancerData')
)
This formula calculates the percentage of lung cancer cases where the diagnosis was made within 6 months of the first symptoms.


9. Average Survival Years
Average Survival Years = AVERAGE('LungCancerData'[SurvivalTime])

10. Total Annual Lung Cancer Deaths
Total Annual Lung Cancer Deaths = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'),
    NOT(ISBLANK('LungCancerData'[DeathDate])),
    YEAR('LungCancerData'[DeathDate]) = YEAR(TODAY()) // This will return deaths for the current year
)
This will count the number of lung cancer-related deaths in the current year. You can adjust the year condition as needed for other years or use a dynamic slicer for annual comparisons.

11. Lung Cancer Prevalence Rate
Lung Cancer Prevalence Rate = 
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('LungCancerData')), [Total Population]) 

Where [Total Population] would be a reference to the total population, either as a fixed value or another measure if you have it in your dataset.

12. Survival Rate by Early Detection
Survival Rate by Early Detection = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'), 
              'LungCancerData'[EarlyDetection] = "Yes", 
              'LungCancerData'[Survived] = "Yes"),
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('LungCancerData'), 'LungCancerData'[EarlyDetection] = "Yes")
)
This formula calculates the survival rate for patients who were diagnosed early (within 6 months of symptoms). It divides the number of survivors in this group by the total number of early-detected patients.

13. Risk_Score = 
    VAR SmokingRisk = IF(lung_cancer_data[Smoker] = "yes", 3, 0)
    VAR PassiveSmokingRisk = IF(lung_cancer_data[Passive_Smoker] = "yes", 2, 0)
    VAR FamilyHistoryRisk = IF(lung_cancer_data[Family_History] = "yes", 2, 0)
    VAR AirPollutionRisk = IF(lung_cancer_data[Air_Pollution_Exposure] = "High", 3, IF(lung_cancer_data[Air_Pollution_Exposure] = "Moderate", 1, 0))

    RETURN SmokingRisk + PassiveSmokingRisk + FamilyHistoryRisk + AirPollutionRisk

14. Age_Group = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    lung_cancer_data[Age] <= 30, "0-30",
    lung_cancer_data[Age] <= 45, "31-45",
    lung_cancer_data[Age] <= 60, "46-60",
    "61+")
