The Lung Cancer Prediction Dataset contains patient records that help in analysing risk factors associated with lung cancer.
It includes demographic details such as age, gender, and country, along with medical and lifestyle factors like smoking habits, passive smoking exposure, and air pollution levels. 
The dataset also provides genetic risk levels, lung cancer diagnosis status, cancer stage, and treatment types, making it useful for predictive modelling and healthcare analytics. 
Additionally, it includes computed risk scores, survival years, and mortality rates, which can be used to assess the impact of different factors on patient outcomes. 
The dataset is valuable for identifying high-risk individuals, studying smoking-related lung cancer trends, and developing early detection strategies. 
Researchers and data analysts can leverage this dataset to build machine learning models for cancer prediction, survival analysis, and personalized treatment recommendations.
